This is a manual straightforward re-implementation in Kotlin of a part of [beacon chain spec v0.10.1](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v0.10.1/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md), for demo and research purposes mainly.

It misses some components like hashing, BLS, merklization. And contains some bugs.

Depends on [tuweni-bytes:0.10.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tuweni/tuweni-bytes/0.10.0).
