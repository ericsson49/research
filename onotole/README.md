A very preliminary version of a project named ["Onotole"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Wasserman) - a python transpiler, intended to be usable with [beacon chain specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/).

Translates to Kotlin currently. Other JVM target languages (Scala, Java 5, Java 8+) are planned.

Depends on [better parse](https://github.com/h0tk3y/better-parse) library.
